# Send-O-Meter
Combining weather data to tell you where you should send it next

Dedicated to my partner Taylor and all the other tropical fish who like to try-hard

## Goal: combine weather data to help people pick where they want to enjoy the outdoors. From basics like temperature and humidity to safety information like AQI. 

# Open feature requests:

    -Temperature
    
    -Pressure
    
    -Humidity
    
    -AQI
    
    -UV index

  - For a given activity categorize the above
  
  - Categorize that day for that area for that activity along a scale of relative 'sendy-ness' 
  for instance, if skiing is the chosen activity, 1" of fresh snow July 4th is going to be more relatively sendy than 1" in February
